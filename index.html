					<p>Gangsters are members of gangs or professional criminal organizations who are known for their involvement in the conduct of acts prohibited by law, especially assassination. For decades, these people have been active in several areas of the world particularly in Europe, Asia, United States and Latin America. Most of these gangsters have become infamous either because of the severity of crimes they committed in the past, the fashion through which they assassinated their victims, or because of the popularity of the people that they killed. Gangsters normally choose to become part of gangs as this provides them with a certain level of organization and support that they cannot get when they operate alone.</p>

					<p>Prohibition and the gangsters are an integral part of America's history in the 1920's. America experienced the Jazz Age and the young who formed the basis of this period's fame wanted alcohol. The 18th Amendment had banned the sale, transportation and manufacture of alcohol in America. But it was clear to some, that millions neither wanted this law nor would respect it. There was obviously a huge market for what in the 1920's was an illegal commodity. It was the gangsters who dominated various cities who provided this commodity. Each major city had its gangster element but the most famous was Chicago with Al Capone.</p>

					<p>Gangsters carry with them an aura of fascination that goes beyond infamy and enters a realm of worship to many. Despite their violent tendencies and criminal enterprises, many gangsters and mobsters are celebrated as folk heroes these days. That is due, more than anything, to the films about gangsters throughout decades of Hollywood. The gangster genre created immortality for the infamous.</p>
